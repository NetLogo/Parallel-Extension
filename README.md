# NetLogo Parallel extension

Experimental extension that allows performing a map operation in parallel on a NetLogo list.

The extension requires NetLogo 5.0beta4 and Scala 2.9.0.1.

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogo.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0 make

If compilation succeeds, `parallel.jar` will be created.
